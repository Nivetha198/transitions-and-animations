        <h1>Nature</h1>
        <p>Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of the human activities.
            The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several delicacies to
            enjoy and is our life support system. Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts
            from nature. Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature. Escaping away in the nature
            heals the mind and body and soothes our soul. Irrespective of what nature provides us it is also our moral
            and social responsibility to nurture nature.</p>
